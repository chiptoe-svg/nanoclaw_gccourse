# NanoClaw gccourse — master plan

Two-phase delivery plan for this fork. Phase 1 ships a working
shared-classroom MVP on shared workspace + shared LLM credit pool. Phase 2
adds per-person accounts, RAG-driven labs, exports, and walkaway
deploy. Detailed designs live in the sub-plans referenced inline;
this file is the sequencing layer.

Plan: [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-agent-playground-v3.html`](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-agent-playground-v3.html). | `worktree-playground-v3` branch, commit range `01c0e5f`..`cbd3974` (24 tasks across 7 phases + prettier hygiene, awaiting `/ultrareview` + merge to `main`) |
| **Phase 1.9 — playground UX + Skills authoring + student provisioning** — add-student button (Home tab), per-agent custom skills with multi-file editor (3-panel Skills tab redesign), chat dropdown hides unauthenticated providers, codex/local model switch without container respawn, OMLX probe auth fix, per-turn codex cost accounting, IDOR gate on all `/api/drafts/:folder` GETs, tunnel single-flight fix, provisionStudent DB rollback on FS failure. Plan: [`plans/skills-tab-redesign.md`](skills-tab-redesign.md), [`plans/external-classroom-access.md`](external-classroom-access.md), review fixes: [`plans/pr4-review-fixes.md`](pr4-review-fixes.md). | `main` (merge `c2f689d1`, PR #4) |

**Phase 1 status: complete.** All 9 build-order items shipped; refactor merged; deploy guide written; two follow-ups shipped (ufw doc, lost-link form). Phase 2 unblocked.

## Phase 1.5 — post-class polish (shipped 2026-05-15)

Slices discovered and shipped DURING the live class day. None
pre-planned in Phase 1; recorded here because Phase 2 #8/9 (RAG
evaluation framework) depends on the per-call trace breakdown
landed here.

| Slice | Commit |
|---|---|
| Per-call `model_call` ProviderEvent — codex multi-tool turns produce N discrete trace entries instead of one summary; client-side renderer in chat.js | `3a10c16` |
| Auto-refresh codex catalog from `developers.openai.com/codex/models` — 24h cache, drop-on-disappear, falls back to BUILTIN_ENTRIES on failure | `9a1769c` |
| Claude support in `/api/direct-chat` (Anthropic Messages wire format, system-field extraction, max_tokens default) | `9400e2a` |
| Provider/model sync on `/provider` switch (resets model to new provider's `default:true` entry); chat-tab model dropdown now PUTs `active-model` + respawn modal; `setModel` kills running containers so changes take effect on next message | `08ae3d1` |
| Persona refresh: `STUDENT_PERSONA` gains a "Quirk" section asking for a dad joke per reply (discoverability hook), applied to all 12 students via `scripts/refresh-student-personas.ts` | `08ae3d1` |
| Raccoon-unicycle rebrand: "NanoClaw Playground" → "Agent Playground", new `/agent-playground-icon.png` route | `6d0ecac` |
| `.gitignore` for `class-roster.csv` + `config/class-controls.json`, removal of `scripts/wire-test-student.ts` | `37dbdad` |
| Codex provider rewrite: emit `tool_use` / `tool_result` ProviderEvents from `item/started` / `item/completed` (matching Claude provider's trace richness); rename `token_count` → `thread/tokenUsage/updated` (codex v0.124+); rename custom TOML provider `openai` → `openai-custom` (codex now reserves built-in IDs) | `08ae3d1` |
| InstructorBot's `allowedModels` synced to current BUILTIN_ENTRIES codex list (gpt-5.5 / 5.4 / 5.4-mini / 5.3-codex / 5.2; dropped stale gpt-5-mini / gpt-5.5-pro) | local-only (groups/ is gitignored) |

**Verification:** email-PIN sign-in flow confirmed working
end-to-end during class with the 10 real Clemson students.

## Phase 1.6 — sign-in friction reduction (shipped 2026-05-18)

Internal-network deployment made the email-PIN-via-Resend + Google
sign-in dance unnecessary. Replaced with in-class passcode entry:
sign-in page asks for email + 4-digit passcode; instructor displays
+ rotates the current passcode from a new Home card. No outbound
email sender needed. First-come-first-served by roster email via
atomic SQLite UPDATE (`WHERE enrolled_at IS NULL`).

| Slice | Commit |
|---|---|
| Class enrollment passcode — schema migration, scrypt-hashed storage, 3 handlers (get/rotate/enroll), roster `enrolled_at` + `enrollment_session_id` columns, login.html rewrite, Home owner-card | `1567c00` on `main` |
| Mirror enrollment Home card to `origin/classroom-x7-provider-auth` so X.7 install skill doesn't blow it away | `e73442f` on `classroom-x7-provider-auth` |
| Login page cosmetic — match playground style.css (brand-navy + brand-blue tokens), drop the raccoon icon from the landing card, switch from missing `home.css` to `style.css` | (uncommitted as of this entry — pure HTML/CSS update on `src/channels/playground/public/login.html`) |
| Plan doc | `plans/class-enrollment-passcode.md` |

**Design note:** `/add-classroom` does NOT need an install-side change.
The enrollment-passcode feature lives entirely in trunk; it activates
whenever the `classroom_roster` table has rows in it (which is what
`/add-classroom` already provisions). Telegram `/playground` magic-
link path is preserved for owner/admin convenience. Google sign-in
moves to an opt-in "Connect" card on student Home (deferred until
Phase 14 GCP setup unblocks).

## Phase 1.7 — classroom polish + provisioning fixes (shipped 2026-05-18)

Slate of fixes + cosmetic improvements that came out of live testing
during X.7 verification + the enrollment-passcode rollout. Mostly
small, with one architectural cleanup (class-skeleton was silently
provisioning students with the wrong agent provider — a bug that would
make every student message touch Anthropic instead of OpenAI).

| Slice | Commit(s) |
|---|---|
| **Brand identity.** Raccoon-unicycle icon retired across login + topbar. Replaced with the NanoClaw Classroom wordmark (`/classroom-nano.png`). | `cb01716` |
| **Login page redesign.** Self-contained `<style>` (no external stylesheet dependency since `/style.css` was 401'ing pre-auth), email + passcode form, paste-back flow with a clickable "Open sign-in page" button (popup-blocker fallback). | `787ae67`, `08c3492`, `3e36ad5` (X.7 branch), `e92a928` (style.css) |
| **Class-skeleton bugs.** Students were provisioned with `agent_provider=null` (defaulting to claude) — fix: hard-code `'codex'` for all class members. Same for `container.json.provider`. Also `agent_groups.name` was being set to the folder slug (`student_03`) instead of the real student name from `class-config.json` — fix wires through `target.name`. Model default changed to `gpt-5.4-mini` for cost. Bulk-applied to the 12 existing students. | `6aac696`, `1c0b796`, `e5ba324`, `fc9b429` |
| **Trunk hot-fix.** `handleGetStudentsUsage` used CommonJS `require()` in an ESM module → 500 on every roster fetch. Hoisted to static import. | `5eb10bd` |
| **Roster card overhaul.** Walks `class-config.json`'s `students[]` + `tas[]` instead of session directories — now shows every roster member, not just those with active sessions. Columns: Name / TA badge / This-month $ / Total $ / Activated ✅. "Activated" = `classroom_roster.enrolled_at != null` (set by `/login/enroll`). Strict definition; students who chatted via the older Telegram + email-PIN flow re-activate by signing in via the new passcode flow. | `3a210ae`, `4869147`, `27c0efd`, `983a90a`, `6ed2459` |
| **Trace panel rework.** Each user submit starts a new turn group with timestamp header + live-updating totals footer (turn-aggregate of in/out/cached/cost). Disclosure triangles on tool entries now visibly indicate clickable expansion. | `e92a928`, `787ae67` |
| **Caroline Yaman provisioned as `ta_01`** via class-skeleton (`cyaman@clemson.edu`). First TA on the roster. | (provisioned at this commit's run time) |
| **`apikey` backport** from classroom-x7-provider-auth → main. Codex CLI's `auth.json` schema uses `'apikey'`, not `'api_key'`. | `b99d47c` |
| **Trunk admintools rehydration.** `b938228` had extracted too much: `models.ts` imports survived but their helpers (`model-discovery`, `model-switch`, `model-providers/*`) moved to admintools-only. A fresh `git clone` of main wouldn't build. Hoisted the helpers back to trunk; admintools now only ships the Telegram-command surface. | `e3c8613` |
| **`origin/classroom` modernization (path-a).** 616 commits of drift wiped with a "main wins" merge + 12 classroom-skill-managed files restored + API-surface refactors for current trunk (googleapis → @googleapis/drive; inline classroom-specific config consts that Phase 11.3 stripped from trunk). | `bfa1175` on `origin/classroom` + `1819c3b` on `main` |
| **CI: nightly long-lived-branch sync.** `.github/workflows/sync-long-lived-branches.yml` runs daily; conflict-free fast-forwards push, conflicts open issues with the path-(a) recipe. | `4ae748e` |

**Live verification.** Student OAuth confirmed end-to-end —
`data/student-provider-creds/class_student_01/codex.json` written with
`active: 'oauth'`, `oauth.account: 'tonkin@clemson.edu'`, refresh-token
intact. Per-request credential proxy hook resolves to the student's
OAuth token. The "use my own credentials" path students will follow
is the same one this test exercised.

**Architecture decision to revisit (not blocking).**

Today's churn surfaced that this fork's trunk has accumulated a lot
of classroom-specific code (X.7 Providers card, Phase 14 Google
integration, enrollment passcode, Roster card, email+passcode login,
class-skeleton, classroom_roster) — some by design, some by today's
commit-pattern accidents. CLAUDE.md rule 5 says "trunk should be
infrastructure every install needs, not features any subset uses,"
but in practice this fork only ever deploys as a classroom-product.

Three options when ready to clean up: (A) strict rule-5 split, pull
classroom out of trunk back to branches; (B) declare this fork's
trunk = classroom-ready Codex-pool, retire `origin/classroom*` branches,
make skills layer ONLY truly-optional things; (C) hybrid — slim
classroom path stays in trunk, X.7/Phase14-style advanced layers stay
skill-installable for upstream-portability.

Decision deferred. For now: trunk-with-classroom-stuff is the deployed
reality; living with it. Revisit when one of:
- Upstream `qwibitai/nanoclaw` wants to merge something from this fork
- A second classroom install diverges enough to need real separation
- A classroom-specific subsystem starts drifting between a trunk copy
  and a skill-installed copy (the X.7 fold-in removed the one instance
  of this that existed)

**Open follow-ups (not blocking the phase).**
- *Trace disclosure for model_call / agent_call.* Today's trace UI
  added disclosure for tool calls (which carry rich payload) and
  direct calls (full prompt+response client-side). model_call and
  agent_call still show one-line summaries; making them disclosable
  requires the agent-runner's provider modules to emit prompt+response
  in the ProviderEvent. Plan: [`trace-call-disclosure.md`](./trace-call-disclosure.md).
- *Phase 14 GCP step.* Still operator-blocked. 5-min GCP Console
  click-through (redirect URI + test users + scopes). Gates the
  Google "Connect" card on student Home.
- *Deprecate `/add-classroom-auth`.* Old Codex-only magic-link
  auth.json upload, superseded by `/add-classroom-provider-auth`. Mark
  its `SKILL.md` description with a deprecation pointer (5 min).
- *Two long-lived branches still drift* (providers 737, admin 273
  commits behind main). Sync action runs nightly; conflicts file
  issues. Apply path-(a) treatment when each one next needs an
  update. (`gws-mcp` was retired 2026-05-19 — see Cross-cutting.)
- ~~*Trunk vs. X.7-install state asymmetry.*~~ ✅ **Resolved
  2026-05-19** — the full X.7 subsystem was folded into trunk
  (commit `e0ef45a`): per-student storage, resolver, OAuth routes,
  Class Controls v2 schema, Providers card, Models status pills.
  The "X.7 stays skill-installable" rule is formally retired for
  this fork; `/add-classroom-provider-auth` and the
  `classroom-x7-provider-auth` branch are now redundant.

## Phase 1.8 — agent-harness benchmark suite (B1–B3 implemented, B4 pending run)

Triggered by the 2026-05-18 cost spike: a single "yolo" message on
codex/gpt-5.4 billed at $1.10 because codex makes 6–10 internal API
calls per user turn and each one replays the full conversation +
prior tool outputs. We don't have a calibrated picture of the cost
surface we're shipping to instructors.

**Goal.** A repeatable benchmark suite that produces comparable
cost / latency / quality metrics across (provider × model × harness
config) combinations. Used to quantify the codex / claude gap,
inform harness optimization, and give instructors data-backed model
recommendations.

**Distinct from Phase 2 #9 (classroom evaluation framework).** That
is the student-facing side-by-side comparison UI; this is internal
developer tooling. Lands first because the eval-framework's design
benefits from us having concrete cross-harness data already.

**5-request suite** spans the cost curve: trivial no-tool greeting,
single-tool clock, single-fetch synthesis, three-turn continuation,
multi-fetch comparative research. Each isolates a different
amplification factor. Three reps per (system × request) cell. Six
V1 systems in the matrix (Anthropic Sonnet + Haiku, Codex
gpt-5.4 + gpt-5.4-mini, two local MLX models). Three assessment
layers: token/cost/latency (auto), programmatic correctness per
request (deterministic), claude-haiku-as-judge quality rubric.

**Status.** B1+B2 implemented in `main`. Scripts: `bench.ts`,
`bench-db.ts`, `bench-gates.ts`, `bench-judge.ts`, `bench-fixture-server.ts`,
`bench-prompts.json`, `bench-fixtures/`. BENCH_MODE session fix landed
(`server.ts` now mints bench sessions as owner so `canReadDraft`
passes on the bench agent group's SSE stream). B2 judge calls the
credential proxy directly (no playground round-trip) with
`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`; score + rationale land in `runs.quality_score`
+ `runs.notes`. Run via:
```
BENCH_MODE=1 pnpm run dev   # in one terminal
pnpm exec tsx scripts/bench.ts --source <folder> --systems claude-sonnet --reps 3
pnpm exec tsx scripts/bench-report.ts
```

**Phasing.** B1 ✅ baseline runner → B2 ✅ LLM-judge quality rubric →
B3 ✅ multi-system matrix (claude-sonnet, claude-haiku, codex-5.4,
codex-5.4-mini, local-qwen3) → B4 full matrix run, first diagnostic
dataset. B4 is a single command — requires host running with BENCH_MODE=1
and (optionally) mlx-omni-server for local-qwen3:
```
BENCH_MODE=1 pnpm run dev   # terminal 1
pnpm exec tsx scripts/bench.ts --source <folder> \
  --systems claude-sonnet,claude-haiku,codex-5.4,codex-5.4-mini \
  --reps 3
pnpm exec tsx scripts/bench-report.ts
```

Detailed plan: [`agent-benchmark-suite.md`](./agent-benchmark-suite.md).

## Phase 1 — shared-classroom MVP

**Goal.** A class can deploy with: one Google Workspace OAuth
(instructor's, shared by everyone), one LLM provider OAuth
(instructor's, shared as a credit pool), a homepage students log into
via personal email, an embedded Agent Playground, and working
Drive/Sheets/Calendar/Slides tools with NanoClaw-side ownership
friction. No per-student GWS or per-student LLM auth yet.

**Setup story (the experience we're delivering).** Instructor runs
`/setup`, picks a CLI and authorizes it, picks an agent provider
(typically Codex/OpenAI) and authorizes it, runs `/add-classroom` +
`/add-classroom-gws` to provision the class workspace, then
`/add-gws-tool` to wire GWS into student agents. Students get
homepage URL + Telegram link; they log in via personal email; their
LLM calls run on instructor's pool; their docs live in the class
workspace with anyone-with-link sharing.

### Build order

The order matters: each item below depends on the one or two above
it. Items at the same nesting depth can run in parallel.

1. ✅ **`wasFallback` infra prerequisite.** Shipped on `main`
   (commit `90caf28`). `getGoogleAccessTokenForAgentGroup` returns
   `{ token, principal: 'self' | 'instructor-fallback' }`. Used by
   13.6 and every 13.5* tool.
2. ✅ **gws-mcp Phase 13.6 — shared-classroom mode ownership primitive.** Built
   on `feat/gws-skill-refactor` (commits `28e2c45`, `670de8d`,
   `06d7493`). After the refactor merge, this code lives on
   `origin/classroom` and is installed by `/add-classroom-gws`.
   Details: [gws-mcp.md §13.6](gws-mcp.md).
   **Refactor follow-on:** The whole GWS surface was extracted from
   trunk to `origin/gws-mcp` + `origin/classroom` per rule 5
   (commits `dc7f429`, `1d0bbac` on `feat/gws-skill-refactor`).
   Trunk keeps `gws-auth.ts` (playground needs it) + `gws-token.ts`
   (credential proxy needs it).
3. ✅ **gws-mcp Phase 13.5a — Sheets read/write.** Shipped on
   `origin/gws-mcp` (commit `c5c614d`) + `/add-gws-tool` SKILL.md
   updated on `main` (`5e7e0c1`). Details: [gws-mcp-v2.md §13.5a](gws-mcp-v2.md).
4. ✅ **gws-mcp Phase 13.5e — Slides create/append/replace-text.**
   Shipped on `origin/gws-mcp` (commit `7c61346`) + `/add-gws-tool`
   SKILL.md updated on `main` (`1d3deb3`). Same ownership-tag
   mechanism as Docs/Sheets (Slides are Drive files). Details:
   [gws-mcp-v2.md §13.5e](gws-mcp-v2.md).
   *(13.5b Calendar pushed to Phase 2 — see "GWS Phase 1 closes here"
   note below.)*
5. ✅ **credential-proxy Phase X.4 — instructor provider OAuth
   (verification slice).** Live-install audit (2026-05-11) found
   that the proxy already handles every provider auth shape this
   install actually uses (Codex apikey, Anthropic OAuth, raw API
   keys). The only path needing new code is Codex `auth_mode:
   "chatgpt"`, which bypasses `OPENAI_BASE_URL` entirely and needs a
   host-side OAuth refresh daemon — deferred to a Phase 1 follow-up,
   paired with the `/codex-auth` admin command. X.4 reduced to:
   (a) static verification of the class apikey wiring chain
   (`src/index.ts:20` imports `class-codex-auth`, container-runner
   sets `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to proxy, proxy swaps in `.env`'s
   `OPENAI_API_KEY` on `/openai/*`), (b) regression test in
   `credential-proxy.test.ts` for the `x-nanoclaw-agent-group`
   header on the Anthropic OAuth path (8 tests pass, was 7),
   (c) audit `/setup` + `/add-classroom` SKILL.md prompts — no
   gap, CLI pick covered by `nanoclaw.sh`, provider+OAuth covered
   by `/add-classroom` step 5. Live end-to-end smoke deferred to
   first real class deploy. Details:
   [credential-proxy-per-call-attribution.md §X.4](credential-proxy-per-call-attribution.md).
6. ✅ **classroom Phase 4 (Phase-1 slice) — class login tokens
   (the URL-as-identity flow).** Shipped: trunk hook
   `registerClassTokenRedeemer` on `main` (commit `a730aa8`);
   classroom-side `class-login-tokens.ts` + migration + CLI resource
   on `classroom` branch (commit `c7298b0`); `/add-classroom` SKILL.md
   updated. Instructor mints `ncl class-tokens issue --email <e>` per
   roster row, distributes the URLs via their channel of choice. Lost-
   URL recovery via `ncl class-tokens rotate --email <e>`. Full Phase 4
   (dashboard, Telegram link, provider settings) deferred until OAuth
   unblocks browser smoke + Mac Studio LAN IP is assigned. Web
   self-serve "Lost your link?" form + Resend integration tracked as
   a Phase 1 #6 follow-up (~1.5 hr) — not blocking #7 onward.
7. ✅ **classroom Phase 6 — local-LLM runbook + .env.** Shipped:
   `docs/local-llm.md` (mlx-omni-server / Ollama / LM Studio install +
   `.env` config + sizing guidance + troubleshooting). Credential-proxy
   audit done — `OPENAI_BASE_URL` already supports arbitrary upstream
   hosts cleanly (no hardcoded `openai.com` checks, host/port/protocol
   driven by the parsed URL). `/add-classroom` SKILL.md links the
   runbook as a local-LLM alternative to `CLASS_OPENAI_API_KEY`.
8. ✅ **ai-coding-cli Phase G — smoke matrix.** Programmatic coverage
   shipped in `setup/lib/ai-coding-cli/resolve.test.ts` (11 tests
   covering install-state + env-var combinations non-destructively
   via per-adapter `isInstalled()` mocking). Destructive-scenario
   items (uninstall a CLI, force setup failure, terminal-prompt UX)
   deferred to deployment-time verification with the live matrix
   tracked in [upstream-pr-prep.md §1](upstream-pr-prep.md). Live
   install state verified (both `claude` + `codex` installed; no
   `NANOCLAW_AI_CODING_CLI` set, so setup would hit the
   two-installed-picker branch on re-run). Adapter contract that the
   picker depends on already covered by `index.test.ts`.
9. ✅ **`scripts/gws-authorize.ts`** — already existed (commit `7e54dd9`
   from May 6, predating the plan note that said "still pending").
   Enhanced today to deliver the OAuth URL via a tmp file (mode 0600)
   instead of inline-print only — matches the
   `feedback_gws_auth_flow` memory note that terminal wrap breaks
   copy-paste. Inline URL kept as a fallback. SIGINT cleanup wipes
   the URL file on Ctrl-C since it has the client_id embedded.

### Phase 1 success criteria

- Instructor runs `/setup` end-to-end without manual file edits and
  ends up with a class workspace + provider auth + working agent
  groups + working homepage stub.
- A test student can log into the homepage via their bookmarked
  `?token=...` URL (no Google OAuth required), access the embedded
  playground, and trigger an LLM call that hits the class API
  credit pool (or instructor ChatGPT OAuth as fallback / local LLM
  if configured).
- A test student can ask their agent to create a Google Doc; the
  doc lands in the class workspace with `nanoclaw_owners` set and
  anyone-with-link sharing. Anyone with the link (instructor /
  other students who get it shared) can open it.
- A second student cannot delete or overwrite the first student's
  doc through their agent — relay returns the hard-block error
  with the creator's display name.
- Sheet read/write and slides create/append/replace-text work
  end-to-end; writes on someone else's doc/sheet/slides are
  hard-blocked in shared-classroom mode.
- Local LLM deploy (mlx-omni-server / Ollama / LM Studio per
  `docs/local-llm.md`) is a documented alternative to the API
  credit pool; `/model` Telegram command discovers models from the
  local server's `/v1/models`.

(Calendar, Gmail, Drive listing deferred to Phase 2 — they earn
their utility only when each user has their own Google account.
Provider settings UI / dashboard / Telegram link panels deferred
until OAuth + Mac Studio LAN IP unblock.)

## Phase 2 — Full classroom capability (per-person accounts + labs)

**Goal.** Layer per-person Google Workspace OAuth (per-person mode) and
per-person provider OAuth on top of Phase 1, add agent export,
RAG-driven labs with evaluation framework, and walkaway cloud deploy.

**Design + sequencing.** Detailed scope, architecture summary, and
sub-plan cross-links live in the Phase 2 index docs:
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-15-classroom-per-person-mode-design.md`](../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-15-classroom-per-person-mode-design.md)
(scope + success criteria + open questions) and
[`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-15-classroom-per-person-mode.md`](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-15-classroom-per-person-mode.md)
(checkbox build order with sub-plan links per slice). The build-order
list below remains the canonical sequencing layer for cross-Phase
dependency tracking.

### Build order

1. **Phase 14 — per-person GWS OAuth (per-person mode).** Magic-link flow on
   the student-auth-server, per-user credentials at
   `data/student-google-auth/<id>/`, `/gauth` Telegram command.
   Partly blocked on GCP redirect URI registration — see
   `project_gcp_oauth_pending` memory. Details:
   [gws-mcp.md §Phase 14](gws-mcp.md).
2. ✅ **credential-proxy Phase X.7 — per-student provider OAuth +
   temp-password fallback.** Students authorize their own provider
   account via magic-link; resolver falls back to instructor pool if
   no per-student token. Instructor can issue a time-bounded temp
   code (`ncl temp-creds grant --user X --hours 24`) that grants
   instructor-pool access during student onboarding. Details:
   [credential-proxy-per-call-attribution.md §X.7](credential-proxy-per-call-attribution.md).
   **Shipped + folded into trunk** 2026-05-19 (commit `e0ef45a`) —
   the subsystem was merged into trunk rather than kept as a skill
   install. Full task breakdown:
   [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-per-student-provider-auth.md`](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-per-student-provider-auth.md).
3. **gws-mcp Phase 13.5b — Calendar list/create.** Earns its keep
   once each user has their own calendar (per-person mode). In shared-classroom mode it
   collapses to a single shared workspace calendar and doesn't need
   agent tooling. Details: [gws-mcp-v2.md §13.5b](gws-mcp-v2.md).
4. **gws-mcp Phase 13.5c — Drive listing.** Safe to expose once
   per-person mode lands — Google's own auth scopes the result. Details:
   [gws-mcp-v2.md §13.5c](gws-mcp-v2.md).
5. **gws-mcp Phase 13.5d — Gmail search/send.** Same reasoning.
   Details: [gws-mcp-v2.md §13.5d](gws-mcp-v2.md).
6. **classroom Phase 4 (Phase-2 slice) — provider settings panel.**
   Adds the homepage UI for students to manage their own provider
   OAuth + GWS OAuth + temp-code redemption.
7. **classroom Phase 5 — agent export tooling.**
   `nanoclaw / claude-code / codex / json` formats; `GET
   /api/draft/<folder>/export?format=…`. Spec in
   [classroom-web-multiuser.md §Phase 5](classroom-web-multiuser.md).
7b. **NEW: classroom Phase 5b — Agent library + save/swap UX
   (UNPLANNED).** Distinct from §5 (which is one-direction export
   for take-home). 5b is the in-playground File-menu-for-agents:
   Save current agent state as a named library entry, Save As to
   create a new entry, Open to swap the active agent, optional
   versioning / branching. `library/default-agents/*.json` is the
   seed storage but the wrapping UX is undesigned. Needs a spec +
   plan pair under `docs/superpowers/` before execution. Probably
   slots before Phase 5 (export) since export depends on the
   "what's the current agent" notion being clearly addressable
   — though both could land independently and reuse the same
   underlying `groups/<folder>/` source of truth.
8. **classroom Phase 7 — expert system builder + RAG strategies.**
   Pipeline framework + named strategies + UI. Cost-economical only
   after Phase 1 #8 (local-LLM runbook) lands. Spec in
   [classroom-web-multiuser.md §Phase 7](classroom-web-multiuser.md).
9. **classroom Phase 8 — evaluation framework.** Side-by-side
   comparison + LLM-as-judge mode. Depends on Phase 7 (nothing to
   evaluate without strategies). Spec in
   [classroom-web-multiuser.md §Phase 8](classroom-web-multiuser.md).
10. **classroom Phase 9 — walk-away cloud deploy.** Bundle +
   bootstrap script. Depends on Phase 5 (export) for the bundle
   format. Spec in
   [classroom-web-multiuser.md §Phase 9](classroom-web-multiuser.md).

### Phase 2 success criteria

- A student can complete their own Google OAuth and have their
  agent operate as them against their own Drive (Google's own
  boundary, not NanoClaw's).
- A student can opt into per-person provider OAuth; if they don't
  before the temp code expires, their LLM access stops gracefully.
- An instructor can export an agent in any of four formats and
  re-import it cleanly.
- A RAG strategy lab runs end-to-end with side-by-side evaluation.
- A class can be bundled and walked away with — one bootstrap
  script on a fresh VPS reproduces the working state.

## Phase 1 follow-ups (deferred)

Items surfaced during Phase 1 work but not blocking the close-out.
Slot into Phase 2 or a small interleave when convenient.

- ~~**Web "Lost your link?" form on `/login`** + Resend integration~~
  ✅ shipped 2026-05-12. Trunk hook (`registerLostLinkRecoverer` +
  POST `/login/recover` route + form) on `main` (commit `b1a0346`);
  classroom-side recoverer + Resend send on `origin/classroom`
  (commit `25e0c41`). Anti-enumeration: identical success response
  whether email is on roster or not. Three RESEND_* env vars in
  `.env` enable it (same vars as `/add-resend`); falls back to
  "contact instructor" message when unset. 3 new vitest cases.
- **Trace surfacing for non-Claude providers** (Codex, OpenCode,
  Ollama, …). The playground's trace panel renders tool calls / tool
  results in real time (commit `a83794d`), but only the Claude SDK
  provider currently emits the underlying `tool_use` / `tool_result`
  ProviderEvents. Each non-default provider needs an equivalent scan
  in its `translateEvents` (Codex's app-server protocol, OpenCode's
  stream shape, etc.) — same envelope shape so the client renderer
  doesn't need per-provider branches. **~30 min per provider**; do
  when the operator's actual class agent provider lands somewhere
  other than `claude`. Files to touch:
  - `container/agent-runner/src/providers/codex.ts` (lives in trunk)
  - `container/agent-runner/src/providers/opencode.ts` (`providers`
    branch — needs porting via `/add-opencode` skill update too)
  - any future provider's `translateEvents`
  The `kind: 'trace'` route in `src/delivery.ts` and the client
  renderer in `app.js` are provider-agnostic — provider work only.
- **Codex ChatGPT-subscription OAuth refresh daemon** + **`/codex-auth`
  Telegram admin command.** Bundle: the admin command flips
  `~/.codex/auth.json` into chatgpt mode, and the daemon keeps it
  refreshed thereafter. ~3 hr total (~1 hr command + ~2 hr daemon).
  Surfaced when scoping X.4 (2026-05-11) — current install runs
  apikey mode exclusively (verified: `~/.codex/auth.json` has
  `auth_mode: "apikey"`, no `tokens`, no `last_refresh`), and the
  proxy already swaps in `.env`'s `OPENAI_API_KEY` for that path. The
  chatgpt path is master-plan Phase 1 success criterion #2's
  "instructor ChatGPT OAuth as fallback" and is reachable but
  unexercised on this install; build when someone needs it.
  **Daemon shape:** mirror the Anthropic OAuth refresh primitive
  already in `credential-proxy.ts` (`getOAuthToken()` +
  `refreshAnthropicOAuthToken()` + single-flight guard +
  persist-back). New module `src/codex-oauth-refresher.ts`, timer
  refreshes ~5 min before `tokens.expires_at`, writes back via the
  codex CLI's own writer (not hand-rolled JSON — see auth.json
  format note below). Lives on trunk because it's auth infra, not
  classroom-specific.
  **Admin command (`/codex-auth`)** alongside `/auth`, `/model`,
  `/provider`. Flips `~/.codex/auth.json` between ChatGPT
  subscription OAuth (`auth_mode: "chatgpt"`) and OpenAI API key
  mode (`auth_mode: "apikey"` — note **no underscore** in codex's
  format) without hand-editing the file. Companion to `/auth`
  (which only switches Anthropic mode); make this the codex-aware
  equivalent.
  **Implementation note:** the codex auth.json format is poorly
  documented and trivially easy to get wrong — when I first tried
  to hand-roll `auth_mode: "api_key"` (underscored, mirror of
  Python style) codex returned 401 on `/v1/responses`. The
  correct path is to shell out to the codex CLI's own writer:
  `printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | codex login --with-api-key` for
  api-key mode, and `codex logout` + tell the user to re-run
  `codex login` for chatgpt mode (the latter requires interactive
  browser auth, can't be fully automated from Telegram).
  Lives on `admin` branch alongside the other admin handlers.
- ~~agent_groups.agent_provider ↔ container.json drift~~ ✅ fixed
  on `admin` branch (commit `9074e0c`) — `setProvider` now updates
  `agent_groups.agent_provider` alongside `container.json` and
  `sessions.agent_provider`. Regression test pinned in
  `provider-switch.test.ts`. Found during Phase 1 verification
  when `/model` listed Claude models for a codex group on this
  install; root cause was setProvider only updating 2 of 3 sources.
  Existing installs may have drifted rows from before this fix —
  one-off SQL to reconcile:
  `UPDATE agent_groups SET agent_provider = (SELECT json_extract(...))`
  is doable but not worth scripting for the handful of groups
  affected; manual `ncl groups update --provider <p>` works too.
- ~~**Container can't reach GWS relay on port 3007** when ufw is
  active without an explicit allow rule for docker0 traffic~~ ✅
  fixed 2026-05-12 — `/add-gws-tool` SKILL.md step 9b documents
  the `sudo ufw allow in on docker0 to any port 3007 proto tcp`
  rule + the verify step.

## Cross-cutting

- **Live in-browser smoke for classroom Phases 1–3.** Gated on the
  Mac Studio having a LAN IP + the GCP redirect URI being registered
  for that IP. See `project_gcp_oauth_pending` memory.
- **Upstream `qwibitai/nanoclaw` PR candidates.** Tracked per
  subsystem in [upstream-pr-prep.md](upstream-pr-prep.md). Phase 1
  (multi-user playground fix) is the cleanest standalone candidate;
  held until live verification.
- **Branch hygiene.** Merges to `main` and to `origin/classroom` use
  `--no-ff` so each phase stays revertable as a single merge commit.
  Feature branches deleted (local + remote) once merged.
- ~~**Modernize the `origin/classroom` long-lived branch.**~~
  **RESOLVED 2026-05-17 via path (a).** Merged `origin/main` into
  `origin/classroom` as commit `bfa1175`. Main-wins on 9 conflicts.
  12 classroom-skill-source-of-truth files restored (main had deleted
  them via Phase 11.3 "strip class feature from main"). Three files
  needed API surface updates against current trunk: `class-drive.ts`
  migrated `googleapis` → `@googleapis/drive`; `student-auth-server.ts`
  inlined the 3 classroom-specific config consts that Phase 11.3
  stripped from trunk; `student-auth-server.test.ts` mock fix. One
  classroom-side fix preserved: `auth_mode: 'apikey'` in
  `class-codex-auth.ts` (commit `44562b5`) — flagged as possible
  backport-to-main since trunk currently has `'api_key'` which may
  also be wrong. Build clean, 816/816 tests on merged tip.
  Future cadence: re-merge `main` forward into `origin/classroom`
  periodically (same pattern as `origin/channels`, `origin/providers`,
  `origin/gws-mcp`) to prevent drift accumulating again.
  - Backported the `auth_mode: 'apikey'` fix to `main` as commit
    `b99d47c` (empirically verified against `~/.codex/auth.json` —
    Codex CLI writes `'apikey'`, not `'api_key'` or `'apiKey'`).
- **Long-lived branch sync — automation in place.** Surfaced
  2026-05-17 after fixing classroom: the same drift problem applies
  to every long-lived category branch. Audit at the time:
  `providers` was 737 commits behind main, `admin` 273, `gws-mcp`
  210. Nobody was running the periodic sync the rule-5 pattern
  assumes. Fix: `.github/workflows/sync-long-lived-branches.yml`
  runs daily at 12:17 UTC, attempts `git merge origin/main` on each
  of `classroom`, `providers`, `admin`. Conflict-free →
  push. Conflicts → open a GitHub issue with the resolve recipe
  (auto-deduplicated by title, auto-closed on next clean run).
  - **Path-(a) treatment still needed for 2 branches before
    automation can take over them cleanly:**
    - `providers` (737 behind) — sync when next updating
      `/add-opencode` or any future provider install skill.
    - `admin` (273 behind) — sync when next updating
      `/add-admintools`.
  - **`gws-mcp` retired 2026-05-19.** The GWS MCP code (relay +
    Docs/Sheets/Slides/Calendar/Gmail tools) had fully landed in
    trunk, 252 commits ahead of where the branch sat — the branch
    and `/add-gws-tool` were redundant. Branch deleted, skill
    removed, `gws-mcp` dropped from the sync-workflow matrix.
    Until each path-(a) sync lands, the nightly job will keep
    filing fresh conflict issues for that branch — that's working
    as intended; the issue is the prompt to do the path-(a) work.
- **`/ultrareview` policy.** Per the `feedback_ultrareview_before_merge`
  memory: run `/ultrareview` *before* merging feature work, not
  after. Going forward, build phase items on feature branches and
  review-then-merge.

## How to use this file

- When starting a session, read the current phase's build order and
  pick the first unblocked item.
- When an item ships, record its merge commit in the "What's shipped"
  table at the top.
- When a sub-plan adds new phases or new design decisions, update
  the relevant Phase 1 or Phase 2 section here so the delivery
  ordering stays accurate.
- When all Phase 1 items are shipped, declare Phase 1 complete and
  shift focus to Phase 2. Don't start Phase 2 items early — keep
  the delivery boundary clean.
