# Classroom Per-Person Mode — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** This is an INDEX plan — it sequences the
> 10 Phase-2 build-order items already detailed in
> `plans/master.md` and the linked sub-plans, and adds the
> Phase 1.5 preconditions that shipped 2026-05-15. Each line links
> to the sub-plan with the actual TDD steps. Do NOT duplicate those
> steps here — open the sub-plan when you implement the slice.

**Goal.** Land Phase 2 (per-person classroom mode) as a sequence of
small, independently-shippable slices on top of the Phase 1
shared-classroom MVP.

**Architecture.** Builds on existing primitives: credential-proxy
header-based attribution, class-login-tokens, classroom_roster,
per-group container.json. Adds per-student credential-store tiers
(GWS + provider), magic-link OAuth flows, temp-code fallback, and a
student-facing provider-settings UI. Design rationale + cross-links:
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-15-classroom-per-person-mode-design.md`](../specs/2026-05-15-classroom-per-person-mode-design.md).

**Tech stack.** Same as trunk — Node host + Bun container + SQLite
session DBs. New work touches `src/gws-token.ts`, `src/credential-
proxy.ts`, `src/channels/playground/public/`, and the
`/add-classroom*` skill family.

## Phase 2 — Per-person mode build order

Order matches `plans/master.md` §"Phase 2 — Full classroom capability".

- [ ] **Phase 14 — per-person GWS OAuth.** Per-student Google
      account connection from the playground home tab. UX pattern
      mirrors the existing Telegram "Connect Telegram" card. PIN
      stays as the identity path; this is opt-in resource auth.
      Instructor bearer remains as fallback for anyone who hasn't
      connected. Detail expanded below; legacy text in
      [`plans/gws-mcp.md` §Phase 14](../../../plans/gws-mcp.md).

  **Prereqs (operator, GCP Console — ~5 min, blocking):**
    - [ ] Add redirect URI `http://130.127.162.180:3002/google-auth/callback`
          to the existing OAuth client (identified by `client_id`
          in `~/.config/gws/client_secret.json`).
    - [ ] OAuth consent screen: scopes include `drive`,
          `gmail.modify`, `calendar`. (Drive already there from
          the original install; gmail + calendar are new.)
    - [ ] OAuth consent screen → Test users: add the 10
          `@clemson.edu` student addresses (Restricted scopes
          require allowlisting until app is verified — out of
          scope for 10 students).

  **Policy for unconnected students:** Personal-data tools
  refuse to fire until the student has connected their Google
  account. Specifically:
    - `drive_doc_read_as_markdown`, `drive_doc_write_from_markdown`,
      `sheet_read_range`, `sheet_write_range`, `slides_*` →
      personal Drive only, **gated**.
    - `gmail_*` (Tier C, all variants) → **gated**.
    - `calendar_create_event`, `calendar_update_event` (Tier D
      write side) → **gated**.
    - `calendar_list_events` (Tier D read side) → also gated
      since there's no class-shared calendar to fall back to.
    - The existing `/workspace/drive/` rclone bind mount
      (per-student folder inside the instructor's shared Drive)
      is **unaffected** — that's a filesystem mount, not an
      MCP tool, and class-shared artifacts remain accessible
      via the same instructor-bearer path Mode A established.
    - Chat, wiki commits, persona editing, skills — all
      **unaffected**; the agent itself is fully usable without a
      Google connection.

  When a gated tool fires for an unconnected student, the tool
  returns a structured error: `connect_required` with a
  human-readable message pointing them at the home-tab "Connect
  Google" card. The agent surfaces this verbatim to the user
  rather than retrying.

  **Tier A — Foundation (no agent-runner behavior change yet;
  this tier wires the credential writer + UI + resolver but
  doesn't introduce the gate. The gate lands per-tool in
  Tier B/C/D so each tool ships with its own policy enforcement
  test):**
    - [ ] `src/student-google-auth.ts` — writer side: store
          per-student credentials at
          `data/student-google-auth/<sanitized_user_id>/credentials.json`.
          Reader side already exists at `src/student-creds-paths.ts`
          and `src/gws-token.ts:159`. Functions:
          `writeStudentCredentials(userId, tokens)`,
          `hasStudentCredentials(userId)`,
          `loadStudentCredentials(userId): GwsTokens | null`,
          `clearStudentCredentials(userId)` (for revoke flow).
    - [ ] `src/gws-token.ts` — extend `getGoogleAccessTokenForAgentGroup`
          with an `options.requirePersonal: boolean` flag. When
          true, resolve user_id from `classroom_roster` by
          agent_group_id, try per-student credentials, return
          null if absent (no instructor fallback). When false
          (existing call sites), keep current behavior: try
          per-student first, fall back to instructor. Personal-
          data tools call with `requirePersonal: true`; the
          rclone bind mount keeps calling with the default.
          Update returned `principal` to `"student:<user_id>"`,
          `"instructor"`, or `null` accordingly so per-call
          attribution surfaces correctly in proxy logs and usage
          aggregation.
    - [ ] `src/channels/playground/api/google-auth.ts` — new
          handler module with two HTTP routes:
          `GET /google-auth/start` — verify session cookie,
          mint a state token bound to the user_id, build
          Google's consent URL with state + scopes
          (drive + gmail.modify + calendar), redirect.
          `GET /google-auth/callback` — verify state, exchange
          authorization code via `gws-auth.ts:exchangeCodeForTokens`,
          call `writeStudentCredentials(userId, tokens)`,
          redirect back to home tab with `?google_connected=1`.
    - [ ] `src/channels/playground/server.ts` — register the two
          new routes (alongside the existing `/oauth/google/*`
          PIN-flow routes which serve a different purpose).
    - [ ] `src/channels/playground/public/tabs/home.js` — new
          "Google" card mirroring `renderTelegramCard`. States:
          *not connected* → "Connect Google" button; *connected*
          → "Connected as `<email>` · Disconnect". Wire button
          to navigate to `/google-auth/start`; render
          `?google_connected=1` query-param as a transient
          success note.
    - [ ] `src/admin-handlers/gauth.ts` (gitignored — `/add-admintools`-
          installed) — new `/gauth` Telegram command. DMs the
          requester a one-click `/google-auth/start` link. Mirror
          of the existing `/playground` magic-link command.
    - [ ] Update `data/class-shared-students.md` — point students
          at the home-tab "Connect Google" card. No mention of
          required connection (it's optional).

  **Tier B — Drive tools gated on personal connection:**
    - [ ] Update `src/gws-mcp-server.ts` Drive / Sheets / Slides
          handlers to call `getGoogleAccessTokenForAgentGroup(id,
          { requirePersonal: true })`. On null return, respond
          with the `connect_required` error envelope (new
          shared helper) carrying the human message and a link
          to the home-tab card.
    - [ ] Container-side shim in
          `container/agent-runner/src/mcp-tools/gws.ts` —
          translate `connect_required` HTTP response into a
          tool-result whose text is the friendly message, so the
          agent reads it directly. Set `isError: false` so the
          agent treats it as guidance rather than a tool crash.
    - [ ] Integration test: simulate an unconnected student
          invoking `drive_doc_read_as_markdown` → expect
          structured error; connect the student via the writer
          API; expect success on retry.

  **Tier C — Gmail tools (gated on personal connection):**
    - [ ] Add `gmail_search`, `gmail_read_thread`,
          `gmail_send_draft` to `src/gws-mcp-server.ts`. All
          three call the resolver with `requirePersonal: true`;
          return `connect_required` for unconnected students.
          Draft tool returns a draft ID + compose URL; never
          auto-sends (UI-only confirmation).
    - [ ] Add container-side shim in
          `container/agent-runner/src/mcp-tools/gws.ts`.
    - [ ] Add `@googleapis/gmail` to host package.json (pinned).
    - [ ] Smoke test from a connected student's agent + verify
          unconnected-student gate fires.

  **Tier D — Calendar tools (gated on personal connection,
  read + write both):**
    - [ ] Add `calendar_list_events`, `calendar_create_event`,
          `calendar_find_free_slot` to `src/gws-mcp-server.ts`.
          All three gated with `requirePersonal: true` —
          there's no class-shared calendar to fall back to so
          even reads require the student's own connection.
    - [ ] Container-side shim + `@googleapis/calendar` pinned.
    - [ ] Smoke test from a connected student's agent + verify
          unconnected-student gate fires.

  **Open question (revisit before Tier C):** auto-send or
  draft-only for Gmail? Drafts-only is the conservative
  default; the agent presents the composed draft + a compose
  URL the student opens to send manually. Auto-send would
  require its own confirmation pattern (approval primitive?).
- [ ] **credential-proxy Phase X.7 — per-student provider OAuth +
      temp-password fallback.** Same shape as the GWS resolver — a
      per-student tier ahead of the instructor pool, with a
      time-bounded `ncl temp-creds grant --user X --hours 24` to
      let students operate on the pool during onboarding.
      Detail: [`plans/credential-proxy-per-call-attribution.md` §X.7](../../../plans/credential-proxy-per-call-attribution.md)
- [ ] **gws-mcp Phase 13.5b — Calendar list/create.** Earns its
      keep once each user has their own calendar. Skipped in
      shared-classroom mode where everyone shares one workspace
      calendar.
      Detail: [`plans/gws-mcp-v2.md` §13.5b](../../../plans/gws-mcp-v2.md)
- [ ] **gws-mcp Phase 13.5c — Drive listing.** Safe to expose once
      per-person mode lands — Google's own auth scopes the result
      to the authenticated user, no per-call ownership filtering
      needed.
      Detail: [`plans/gws-mcp-v2.md` §13.5c](../../../plans/gws-mcp-v2.md)
- [ ] **gws-mcp Phase 13.5d — Gmail search/send.** Same reasoning.
      Detail: [`plans/gws-mcp-v2.md` §13.5d](../../../plans/gws-mcp-v2.md)
- [ ] **classroom Phase 4 — provider settings panel.** Homepage UI
      for students to manage their own provider OAuth + GWS OAuth
      + temp-code redemption. Depends on Phase 14 + X.7.
      Detail: [`plans/classroom-web-multiuser.md` §Phase 4](../../../plans/classroom-web-multiuser.md)
- [ ] **classroom Phase 5 — agent export tooling.** Four formats:
      `nanoclaw` / `claude-code` / `codex` / `json`. Endpoint:
      `GET /api/draft/<folder>/export?format=…`.
      Detail: [`plans/classroom-web-multiuser.md` §Phase 5](../../../plans/classroom-web-multiuser.md)
- [ ] **classroom Phase 7 — expert system builder + RAG
      strategies.** Pipeline framework + named strategies + UI.
      Cost-economical only after Phase 1 #8 (local-LLM runbook)
      lands.
      Detail: [`plans/classroom-web-multiuser.md` §Phase 7](../../../plans/classroom-web-multiuser.md)
- [ ] **classroom Phase 8 — evaluation framework.** Side-by-side
      strategy comparison + LLM-as-judge mode. Depends on Phase 7
      (nothing to evaluate without strategies). The Phase-1.5
      per-call trace events are a precondition — the evaluation
      needs per-call cost breakdowns.
      Detail: [`plans/classroom-web-multiuser.md` §Phase 8](../../../plans/classroom-web-multiuser.md)
- [ ] **classroom Phase 9 — walk-away cloud deploy.** Bundle +
      bootstrap script. Depends on Phase 5 (export) for the
      bundle format.
      Detail: [`plans/classroom-web-multiuser.md` §Phase 9](../../../plans/classroom-web-multiuser.md)

## Success criteria

(Same as `plans/master.md` §"Phase 2 success criteria".)

- Student completes own Google OAuth → agent operates as them
  against their own Drive.
- Student opts into per-person provider OAuth; if not, LLM access
  stops gracefully at temp-code expiry.
- Instructor exports an agent in any of four formats and
  re-imports it cleanly.
- A RAG strategy lab runs end-to-end with side-by-side evaluation.
- A class can be bundled and walked away with — one bootstrap
  script on a fresh VPS reproduces the working state.

## Execution notes

- Each unchecked slice is its own commit (or small commit cluster)
  with its own test suite — open the sub-plan link above for the
  actual TDD steps.
- The Phase-1.5 trace + catalog + Claude work was discovered
  + shipped DURING the live class, not pre-planned. Captured here
  so the chain of preconditions for Phase 2 #8/9 is explicit.
- Sub-plans MAY have changed since they were last reviewed; if a
  slice doesn't match its sub-plan when you open it, the sub-plan
  is the source of truth — not the bullet here.
